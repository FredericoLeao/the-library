# The Library

The Library is an app I made to show examples of software development skills using Django, APIs, VueJS, Docker, and Git.

## To use it you just need to:
- have docker and docker-compose installed on your computer
- will use port 80, so keep it available
- clone this repository
- $ docker-compose up -d
- point your browser to http://localhost
