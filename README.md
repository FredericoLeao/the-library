# The Library

The Library is an app I made to show examples of software development skills using Django, APIs, Swagger, VueJS, Docker, and Git. Using packages like Django Rest Framework, DRF Yasg, Drf Extra Fields.


## To use it you just need to:
- have docker and docker-compose installed on your computer
- will use port 80, so keep it available
- clone this repository
- $ docker-compose up -d
- point your browser to http://localhost
- I also suggest you run the unit tests
- - [you@app docker shell]$ ./manage.py test --failfast -v3
